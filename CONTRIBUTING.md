## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** — keep them focused on a single concern

3. **Run checks** before submitting:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Write a clear commit message** (see below)

5. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` with:
   - A clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issue (`Closes #123`)
   - Screenshots if the change affects the UI

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Add tests for new functionality where applicable
- Do not change unrelated code in the same PR
- Update documentation if your change affects behavior

---

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strictly — no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer explicit types over inference for function signatures

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with `@theme inline` in `src/app/globals.css`.

- **Never use arbitrary bracket values** when a canonical Tailwind class exists:
  - Spacing: `160px` → `w-40`, `15px` → `mt-3.75`
  - Ring width: `ring-3` not `ring-[3px]`
  - Percentages: `top-1/2` not `top-[50%]`
- Arbitrary values are OK for: `calc()` expressions, CSS variable references, non-standard values
- Repeated hex colors should be added as theme tokens in `globals.css`

### React / Next.js

- Use Server Components by default — add `"use client"` only when needed
- Use Server Actions for mutations (see `src/actions/`)
- Keep components small and focused

### File Organization

```
src/
├── app/           # Pages and API routes only
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── lib/           # Business logic, utilities, external integrations
└── actions/       # Next.js Server Actions
```
